## Overview
This report details the analysis of a security incident at YummyRecipesForMe.com, a cooking website compromised by a brute force attack. The attacker altered the websiteâ€™s code to distribute malware disguised as a file download. This document outlines the network protocols involved, the sequence of events observed, and remediations to prevent similar attacks in the future.

## Section 1: Identify the Network Protocol Involved in the Incident

The primary protocol involved in this incident is **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)**. HTTP was used for the connection between the web server and the client during the delivery of both legitimate and malicious content.

Upon analyzing the tcpdump logs, it was clear that:
1. An HTTP GET request was made to the web server to load the website.
2. The malicious JavaScript embedded in the website triggered a download over HTTP.
3. The malware executed a redirection to another domain, where HTTP was again used to serve malicious content.

The **DNS** protocol was also involved in resolving the domain names "yummyrecipesforme.com" and "greatrecipesforme.com" into their respective IP addresses.

### Network Protocol Chart

| Protocol | Role in the Incident                                | Port   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|--------|
| DNS      | Resolved the IP addresses of the domains            | 53     |
| HTTP     | Facilitated the transfer of the website and malware | 80     |

## Section 2: Document the Incident

### Incident Details
The security event was triggered when several users reported slow performance on their personal computers after visiting the YummyRecipesForMe.com website. They noticed that upon visiting the site, they were prompted to download a file that promised access to free recipes. Once the file was downloaded and run, their browsers were redirected to a fake website (greatrecipesforme.com), which further compromised their systems.

The website owner tried to regain access to the admin panel but found themselves locked out. This prompted the cybersecurity team to investigate the situation further.

### Analysis and Investigation
The cybersecurity analyst used a **sandbox environment** to test the suspicious file while isolating the threat from the company network. During this process, a **tcpdump** capture was performed to monitor network activity. The analysis revealed the following sequence of events:

1. **Initial DNS Request:** A DNS query was sent to resolve the domain "yummyrecipesforme.com."
2. **HTTP GET Request:** The browser successfully loaded the website over HTTP. Immediately after, the site prompted the analyst to download an executable file.
3. **Download and Execution:** After downloading and running the file, the browser initiated a new DNS request for "greatrecipesforme.com."
4. **Redirection:** The browser was redirected to the malicious site, which led to the compromise.

### Incident Timeline Chart

| Step                                | Action/Observation                                                             |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **DNS Request for yummyrecipesforme.com** | The browser sends a DNS request to resolve the domain name for "yummyrecipesforme.com". |
| **HTTP GET Request**                | The browser sends an HTTP GET request to the resolved IP address for "yummyrecipesforme.com". |
| **Prompt for Malicious Download**   | The website prompts the user to download a malicious file disguised as a browser update. |
| **Malware Download and Execution**  | The user downloads and executes the malicious file, compromising their system. |
| **DNS Request for greatrecipesforme.com** | The browser sends a DNS request to resolve "greatrecipesforme.com" after executing the malware. |
| **Redirection to Malicious Site**   | The user is redirected to "greatrecipesforme.com", a fake website containing additional malware. |

### Key Findings
- The attacker exploited a **default admin password** to gain unauthorized access.
- Once inside the admin panel, they altered the source code to distribute malware to visitors.
- The **tcpdump** logs confirmed the transition from legitimate HTTP traffic to malicious HTTP traffic after the malware was executed.

## Section 3: Recommendations to Prevent Brute Force Attacks

In response to this incident, we recommend the following security measures:

### 1. Disallow Default or Reused Passwords
One of the primary vulnerabilities exploited in this attack was the use of a default password. To mitigate this risk, we recommend enforcing a policy that prevents the reuse of old or default passwords during login and password resets.

### 2. Enforce Frequent Password Updates
Regular password updates reduce the window of opportunity for attackers. By requiring users to change their passwords regularly, the risk of brute force attacks succeeding is minimized.

### 3. Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
Adding **MFA** significantly strengthens login security. Even if an attacker guesses the password, they will need an additional authentication factor, such as a one-time password (OTP) sent to the user's phone or email.

### 4. Utilize CAPTCHA for Login Pages
Implementing CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA on the admin login page can prevent automated scripts from attempting to guess passwords. This simple step adds an additional barrier to brute force attacks.

### 5. OS Hardening
Hardening the operating system involves disabling unused services, securing default accounts, and applying all relevant security patches. These steps will reduce the number of exploitable vulnerabilities on the server.

### Prevention Chart

| Recommendation                 | Benefit                                                                                     |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Disallow Default/Old Passwords  | Prevents reuse of compromised passwords, reducing brute force attack success rate           |
| Frequent Password Updates       | Limits attack window by forcing password changes on a regular basis                         |
| Multi-Factor Authentication     | Adds a second layer of security, making password guessing insufficient to gain access       |
| CAPTCHA on Login Pages          | Prevents automated brute force attempts by requiring human verification                     |
| OS Hardening                    | Reduces vulnerabilities by securing system configurations and removing unnecessary services |

## Conclusion

This incident highlights the importance of enforcing robust security practices, particularly around password management and user authentication. By implementing the recommendations outlined above, YummyRecipesForMe.com can better protect itself from brute force attacks and similar cybersecurity threats.

The incident provided valuable insights into how web servers can be compromised and what steps must be taken to prevent such occurrences in the future. This activity also showcases expertise in **network traffic analysis**, **malware investigation**, and **cybersecurity remediation**.
